Project name: Visits Manager.

Idea: In my company there are many visits. Almost every day we host: guests, auditors, external services, authorities, etc. It is difficult to manage them so that the visits do not coincide. Too many visitors at the same time create chaos and organization challenge. This app should help to coordinate visits in the site.

MAIN FUNCTIONS:
- register upcoming visits
- define person responsible for the visitor
- define visit date
- assign conference room (if needed)
- store important information about visitors
- search meetings and visitors
- access - no restrictions, all users can add or modify meetings

Views:
- main view, welcome to application, links to other views
- search meeting
- search visitor
- add a new meeting
- add a new visitor
- add meeting organizer
- add a new company
- back to main page

Visits Manager consists of 2 applications:
1. Meetings - models and views related to Meetings.
2. Visitors - models and views related to Visitors.

API is available for meetings list, individual meeting, visitors list and individual visitor.

There is also a test for each view.
